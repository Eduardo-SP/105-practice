                <h4>If you treat it like work it will be work. If you treat it like fun it will be fun.</h4>
                <p>Passion should be the one thing keeping you going on this journey. Do your best to keep in perspective exactly why you wanted to start in the first place. For me, it was to be engaged in a career where I knew I could have fun.</p>
 
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
